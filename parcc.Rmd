The goal of this project is to help contextualize where PARCC scores come from and what they mean, starting with a fundamental discussion of testing. Most of the PARCC information here comes from the technical report on the 2015 administration of PARCC. 

##[Part 1: Measuring Student Ability](parcc_ability.html)

Part 1 offers an general introduction to what tests measure, not specific to PARCC.

##[Part 2: The PARCC Test](parcc_test.html)

Part 2 provides an introduction to how the PARCC test is structured and scored.
